# Neuromorphic Chip

## Overview

In recent years, Brain-Machine Inspired Cognitive models are making a comeback in the mainstream. Which was a pretty dormant field since 2003. As we progress in deep learning and hit milestones and barriers, the problem of achieving near perfect accuracy, expensive computational power and challenging task questions are ever so increasing. Labs around the world are making an effort to come-up with innovative solutions to tackle these questions. 

**Brain-Machine Inspired Models (BMI)**, are one of the proposed solutions, where state of the art, large pretrained model accuracy and almost perfect accuracy are reached using very few neural connections. It achieves such a fleet by resorting to the fundamentals of “How human brains work?”

Cognitive AI/Neuromorphic Artificial Intelligence is still a growing field where researchers are continuously trying to find answers and better understanding of the brain. I don’t know any universities which offer this course as a program yet. Which is why, I am in the path of teaching myself this field by reading research papers published in top conferences and journals. And reading through documentations of the powerful tools offered to program these intelligence systems and accessing Loihi (Neuromorphic CPU). 

This repository highlights that journey of mine. It is a hobby project. By no means, it’ll be my prime research point in Artificial Intelligence but I am always willing to learn and challenge myself. Maybe in the distant future, I might perform some research on this field but right now, I am learning and sharing my journey on this repository. 

## How to program Neuromorphic AI?

Currently, you can write this AI on **Intel’s Loihi chips.** But, if you can’t afford them, feel free to use the **Nengo library** offered in python to run the fundamental operations on your computer and rest gets run on a Loihi chip in a data centre.

## Is this difficult?

Difficult to answer. But, yah a little bit… Anything new if you’re learning is difficult. But, the code is very easy to follow along and to understand. If you are seasoned in Tensorflow and Pytorch or either of them, you’re good!

*Nengo uses Tensorflow as it’s DL backend to perform Cognitive DL operations.

## Prerequisites

* Watch lectures on Intro Neuroscience either from Harvard/MIT on YouTube
* Advanced Python knowledge
* Tensorflow Proficiency (or Tensorflow + Pytorch)
* 3 weeks programming experience in Computational Neuroscience
* Of course Linear Algebra and Probability
* Extras: Monte Carlo Experiment

I was motivated to start this repository while researching for project ideas at Neuromatch Academy’s Summer School program. To get started with Computational Neuroscience, study their online available Open Source materials.
